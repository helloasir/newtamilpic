# **App Name**: DailyPic Post

## Core Features:

- Daily Image Display: Display a single image corresponding to the current day of the year (e.g., January 1st shows 001.jpg).
- Social Sharing Buttons: Include social media sharing buttons (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) to allow users to easily share the displayed image.
- Automated Social Posting (Scheduled): Implement a scheduled task (e.g., using a cron job or similar) to automatically post the daily image to pre-configured social media accounts. Note:  This MVP will focus on generating the daily page.  Automated social media posting requires more complex API integrations.

- Primary color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean background.
- Secondary color: Dark gray (#333333) for text and headings.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for social media sharing buttons and highlights.
- Simple, single-column layout to focus on the daily image.
- Use recognizable social media icons for the sharing buttons.
- Subtle fade-in animation when the daily image loads.
