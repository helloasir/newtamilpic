        <h1>About Daily Image 2025</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Daily Image 2025, a unique project that brings you a carefully curated image every day throughout the year 2025. Each image tells its own story and has been specifically selected for its particular day.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to bring inspiration, beauty, and thoughtful moments to your daily life through these carefully selected images. Each day presents a new perspective, a new story, and a new opportunity to see the world differently.</p>
        <p>The project runs from January 1st to December 31st, 2025, featuring 365 unique images that progress through the year. You can navigate through past and future images, share them with friends, and return daily for new content.</p>
        <p>We hope these daily images bring joy, inspiration, and moments of reflection to your day.</p>
